This repository contains a JavaScript-based star generator that creates a dynamic and visually stunning starfield without the use of the canvas tag. It features customizable settings such as the number of stars, speed, and color to create a unique and personalized experience. Perfect for use as a background on websites or as a standalone project. Enjoy the beauty of the night sky without leaving your screen.

PS - Because we are utilising div tags rather than canvas tags, the star animation is sluggish.
